# Targeted Mutagens

A mod providing craftable mutagens targeting specific traits for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. Very WIP--there's a lot of them to go through.

This might seem overpowered at first glance but I've tried to balance it out--each targeted mutation requires one appropriate primer, one mutagenic catalyst, and one purifier; there are no threshold targets; there are no post-threshold targets; most starting traits are not included (a lot of them wouldn't make sense anyway--"targeted mutagen: cannibal"?); and none of the recipes are auto-learned. If you have Robust Genetics you can get way more bang for your buck with a catalyst and a couple of primers rather than trying to hunt down and craft every single targeted mutagen you want. 

Also that's a lot of purifier, so you'll either need to raid a lot of labs for human samples or conduct wide-scale human sacrifice to fuel your genetic ascension. 

You can acquire these recipes either through a few themed journals found in labs or by decrypting Science SD Cards. But the recipes from SD Cards are random, so you're not guaranteed to get any particular recipe you want. Happy hunting!
