# Targeted Mutagens

A mod providing craftable mutagens targeting specific traits for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. Very WIP--there's a lot of them to go through.

This might seem overpowered at first glance but I've tried to balance it out--each targeted mutation requires one appropriate primer from a mutation category or one targeted mutagen of the previous step in the chain, one mutagenic catalyst, and one purifier; there are no threshold targets; there are no post-threshold targets; many starting traits are not included (a lot of them wouldn't make sense anyway--"targeted mutagen: cannibal"?); and none of the recipes are auto-learned. If you have Robust Genetics you can get way more bang for your buck with a catalyst and a couple of primers rather than trying to hunt down and craft every single targeted mutagen you want. 

Also that's a lot of purifier, so you'll either need to raid a lot of labs for human samples or conduct wide-scale human sacrifice to fuel your genetic ascension. 

You can acquire these recipes either through a few themed journals found in labs or by decrypting Science SD Cards. But the recipes from SD Cards are random, so you're not guaranteed to get any particular recipe you want. Happy hunting! 

Note: this mod DOES work for NPCs! Just have them use the mutagen out of your inventory exactly as though it were any other kind of mutagen!

BUT DOESN'T THIS GET RID OF THE ESSENTIAL RANDOMNESS OF MUTATIONS?

No, since there's still randomness in acquiring the recipes. But I don't really see this (and am not building this) as a way to complete a specific path in exactly the way you want. This is for adding a few bespoke mutations onto a package you've already selected, or finding the recipe for some mutations that change your choice of threshold because now you meet more of the prerequisites of a different path. It's also a way to keep mutagen crafting going into the late game--instead of making a single big batch and mutating like crazy and then being done until your inevitable death, now you'll want to have some on hand in case you find a recipe for something interesting you could add to your genetic arsenal. 

NOTE: HUMAN SAMPLES

In order to prevent every single targeted mutagen from being cannibalism, since comestibles inherit the materials of their ingredients (see https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/56937 ), this mod also changes human samples. Human samples found in labs contain "Human genetic material" and are not cannibalism, whereas human samples obtained through dissection contain "human flesh" and are cannibalism. If you disagree with or are uninterested in this change, just delete the "human_samples" folder.
