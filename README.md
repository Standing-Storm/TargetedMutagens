# Targeted Mutagens

A mod providing craftable mutagens targeting specific traits for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. Very WIP--there's a lot of them to go through.

This might seem overpowered at first glance but I've tried to balance it out--each targeted mutation requires one appropriate primer, one mutagenic catalyst, and one purifier; there are no threshold targets; there are no post-threshold targets; most starting traits are not included; and none of the recipes are auto-learned. If you have Robust Genetics you can get way more bang for your buck with a catalyst and a couple of primers rather than trying to hunt down and craft every single targeted mutagen you want. 

Also that's a lot of purifier, so you'll either need to raid a lot of labs for human samples or conduct wide-scale human sacrifice to fuel your genetic ascension.
